# RAPP GUI Package

The **responsible academic performance prediction** (RAPP) GUI is a tool to **train, save, load** and **evaluate Machine Learning models** on **any SQLite database**. Users can load a database or a `.csv` file, query custom SQL queries and use the resulting database as training/test data for the implemented Machine Learning pipeline.

For the specific use case of predicting students' performance data from the Heinrich Heine University, this package provides SQL templates that leverages the complexity of feature engineering away from the user.

## How it internally works

1. Loads SQLite database.
2. SQL query on database to obtain a new database.
3. One column of the new database is the target label. The rest are training data. The last column is by default the target.
4. With a given list of categorical columns, those are then one-hot encoded.
5. With the predefined type of the supervised learning task, respective supervised learning algorithms are used. The data is ran through a Machine Learning Pipeline.

## Developer Setup

### Cloning the Repository

Make sure you have installed `git lfs` in your system to correctly clone `data/rapp_dummy.db`.

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hhu-rapp/rapp-tool.git
```

Calculate the sha265 checksum of `data/rapp_dummy.db` (UNIX-like systems):
```bash
sha256sum data/rapp_dummy.db
```

The checksum of the dummy database `data/rapp_dummy.db` should be:
`d5aac60436d931174f2b02ea32c87c7d32f442021022380e8af376b3d817ee69`

### Requirements

Ensure you work on a virtual environment and install the dependencies.
The GUI should work on Python==3.8.

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using conda (anaconda/miniconda), you can create a new environment with:

```bash
conda create -n "rapp-tool" python=3.8
```

and make sure you activate it by:

```bash
conda activate rapp-tool
```

and then install the required packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optionally, if visualisation of decision trees or alike is needed,
make sure that [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) is installed on your
system.

### Required Files

We provide a dummy database `data/rapp_dummy.db` that is compatible with the tool.
The dummy database consists of artificial data that do not represent any real student.
The SQLite database is to be positioned in the `data/` directory:

```tree
data/rapp.db
```

SQL Templates are already available and are compatible with the database. The templates are located in the `sqltemplates/` directory:

```tree
sqltemplates/
```

### First start

The GUI can be started by executing (for Python's virtual environment):

```bash
source env/bin/activate
python -m rapp.gui
```

For conda environment:

```bash
conda activate rapp-tool
python -m rapp.gui
```

For a headless run, settings are provided. To run an example evaluation, simply execute

```bash
python -m rapp --config-file settings/GUI/cs/first_term_ects/cs_first_term_ects_3_dropout.ini
```

The reports are saved under `reports/`.
