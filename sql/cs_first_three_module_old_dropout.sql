-- Features:
--  Binary markers whether Linear Algebra, Programming (Info 1), and
--  Analysis were passed and how many attempts were used.
--  Last achieved grade in Programming. Linear Algebra and Analysis do not
--  have any recorded grades for CS students besides 0.0 (passed?) and 5.0
--  (failed).
-- Target variables:
--  Dropout defined as "no exam written in last 3 semesters"
-- Note:
--  In 2018 PO computer science switched what the first term modules are for
--  students. However, the official suggestion is to still do Analysis in
--  first term and algorithms in third, as per old POs. Allegedly, most
--  students follow this advice.
